### Problem Statement:

 Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue.Signs of breast cancer may include
a lump in the breast ,a change in breast shape,dimpling of the skin,fluid coming from nipple
a newly inverted nipple,or a red scaly patch of skin.Breast cancer is cancer that develops in
breast cells.typically,the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast. Lobules
are the glands that produce milk,and ducts are pathways that bring the milk from the glands
to the nipple .cancer can also occur int the fatty tissue or the fibrous connective tissue within
your breast.
___
### Reasons for Selecting this topic:

 The outlook for women with breast cancer has improved significantly since 1989 as the
mortality rate has declines steadily a decline attribute both to earlier detection through
wider use of a mammography screening and to improved treatments. Yet breast cancer
remains a major problem second lung cancer cause of death from cancer for women this
project aim is to provide and simple technique to predict breast cancer.
___
### Objectives:

 Developing an application using machine learning with python which aim or objective
should promote a common goal for early detection down-staging Breast cancer detection
and diagnoses to improve cancer outcomes.
___
### Motivation:

 We have witnessed that women are hesitant to visit a doctor due to fear of
chemotherapy surgery and death Negative publicity regarding pain during mammograph
is prevalent. basically there is lack of motivation. while breast cancer can be diagnosed
early using various mobile app and tools. One should not forget how important it is to
stay positive and self-motivated no matter what the situation is.
___
### Feasibility study:

 A feasibility study of breast cancer detection with computer aided diagnosis based on
machine learning. the main functionality of application is to give the patient early detection
of breast cancer.
___
### Future Prospects

 The project will help to oneâ€™s to know early and complete cure about any kind of breast
cancer detection.
___
### Methodology:

 This application will use machine learning concept using python .In machine Learning it
will use KNN and SVM,KNN algorithm is one of the simplest classification algorithms.
KNN is a non-parametric,lazy learning algorithm. Its purpose is to use a database in which
the data points are separated into several classes to predict the classification of a new sample
point and SVM is supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for classification
or regression problems.it uses a technique called the kernel trick to transform your data
and then based on these transformations it finds an optimal boundary between the possible
outputs.
